For dealing with the EOSIO blockchain, we have written the smart contract code for this project in C++. Our local EOSIO blockchain is currently operating and giving us access to our local private key and wallet name. Additionally, EOSIO enables us to create smart contracts for many networks. Eosio offers an integrated SDK that gives us access to a variety of smart contract choices and helps us optimise our code.
